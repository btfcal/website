Odds are you’ve walked through Sproul and at any given time there were at least 8 different people trying to give you their organization’s spiel. Arms outstretched, they chorus: “Would you like to join ABC?” 

We’ve been there. And we remember the sensory and auditory overload that accompanies walking through Sproul during the first week of the semester. There’s a whole host of opportunities at Berkeley where you can develop your entrepreneurial skillset, but deciding which ones to pursue is always hard. The incredible variety also doesn’t make navigating the ecosystem easier at all.  What’s easy to spot, however, is the strong undercurrent of entrepreneurship that flows through campus — be it through incubators, student-led VC funds, or even design and consulting organizations, the spirit of innovation is definitely hard to miss on the Berkeley campus.

In continuing to foster that same entrepreneurial spirit, below is a rundown of resources we’d turn to in the Berkeley ecosystem, from clubs and classes that will equip you with the skills needed to code/design/build models to incubators and VC funds that will help you navigate the labyrinth of getting funded and launching.

## Student Orgs

We’ll continue to populate this section with a deep dive into each organization, trying to understand their secret sauce and distilling down everything anyone needs to navigate the collection of Cal *clubs* quickly.

### Blueprint

Blueprint is a group that provides software pro-bono for nonprofits and promotes the use of tech for social good, working alongside organizations such as 1951 Coffee, the San Francisco Art Institute, and Veterans 360. Blueprint has been consistent in helping cultivate software talent for several years now and serves as a main outlet for students to use their technical know-how to make tangible impact. To help expand on their role on campus, we were joined by Nick Wong ‘22, a CS major and technical program lead at Blueprint!

Every semester, they build projects for non-profits and high growth tech companies, empowering students to work with real industry clients. They’ve partnered with a range of companies, from growing startups like Nuro and Ginger to clients as large as Atlassian, as well as local nonprofits like the Berkeley Food Pantry.

## Courses & University Resources

As one of the institutions at the frontier of the study and practice of entrepreneurship, Cal boasts a collection of courses, certificates, and programs to elevate your skills and expand your network as an entrepreneur. Here is a curated collection of the best of these resources.

### Build the Future (UGBA 198)

Build The Future believes in using a collaboration-driven approach in teaching students about entrepreneurship. Our course is not just a speaker series nor lecturing. We have created an intimate environment for students to learn from other students supplemented by our student facilitators’ and guest speakers’ experiences. We have previously hosted prominent entrepreneurs and venture capitalists inclding Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures), Steve Wozniak (Apple), Patrick Collison (Stripe), and Dylan Field (Figma).

Over 13 weeks, the course covers 10 core topics that we believe to be essential tools and knowledges all entrepreneurs must keep in mind. In a given week of the course, students come together for two sessions: one session with a guest speaker and introduction to that week’s core topic and a second session reflecting and discussing that week’s topic with a smaller group of students in the class.
