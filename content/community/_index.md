description: "Patent Pending is a coworking community space by Build the Future. We believe that ideas flourish in environments that foster human connection, good conversation, and creative play. Patent Pending is a place where all three come together. We host co-working sessions every other Thursday from 6-9pm on campus.

Whether you’re hacking away on a side project or drafting a newsletter, you can work on it here alongside other Berkeley students once a month. We’ll have food, drinks, and activities to help you connect with both your work and each other."
