## Welcome New Bears!

Congratulations (and good luck) to the newly admitted class of '25! Please reach out to any of us if you'd like to talk more about our ["number 3" entrepreneurship program in the nation](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-entrepreneurship). If you haven't already, too, check out the [Class of '25 Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/458729248321240). As new incoming freshmen, these are great for sizing up roommates based on what memes they sad react and collectively getting excited about the next semester — hopefully in-person!

Berkeley also announced that it would run [the Changemaker program in Oakland Mills college](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/03/25/berkeley-launches-one-year-residential-program-at-mills-college/). This is a pre-first-semester–summer program that's a tight-knit, single-room–guaranteed way to get acclimated into Berkeley before stepping foot on campus specifically for newly admitted students!

## Crypto and Cal

Berkeley launched arguably the first decentralized finance (DeFi) class at a university ever! The course that combines computer science and finance will be led by Professors [Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) and [Christine Parlour](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/parlour-christine/). Although aimed primarily at PhD students, undergrads can also take the [course that will be rife with lectures about smart contracts and blockchain tech](https://berkeley-defi.github.io/)!

Last week, Cal also partnered with [Parity Tech](https://www.parity.io/), the company behind [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), the sixth-largest blockchain ecosystem in the world. Parity is building the infrastructure for Web 3.0, allowing blockchains to operate both together and at scale. The partnership entails Parity ["[working] with UC Berkeley’s faculty and students in curriculum preparation, project ideas and other initiatives" and "[advising] students and entrepreneurs looking to launch their next blockchain startup"](https://cointelegraph.com/news/uc-berkeley-partners-with-parity-technologies-to-bolster-blockchain-curriculum).

## Work at Dorm Room Fund (DRF)!
