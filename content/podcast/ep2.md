## SkyDeck Demo Day + Internship Fair

SkyDeck, Berkeley's on-campus accelerator, hosted their annual demo day on April 7th. The batch of 17 startups presented in an all-remote setting and consisted of companies like [The Hurd Co](https://thehurdco.com/), a company creating an environmentally-friendly pulp to make clothes from; [Humm](https://thinkhumm.com/), manufacturing a patch that goes on your forehead using [tACS](https://neuromodec.com/what-is-transcranial-alternating-current-stimulation-tacs/) to help sharpen memory, reading, and problem-solving by ~20%; and [NuPort Robotics](https://www.nuport.ai/), a company retrofitting semitrucks with autonomous capabilities. [Yahoo! Finance covered all of the presenting companies here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkeley-skydeck-presents-batch-11-150000775.html). SkyDeck is also hosting an internship fair for prospective students on May 7th — [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcAy6nNDjvsjBS_tanznwOKCSn9r2_ULfM-6Md0RYBO2_Siw/viewform).

Some unresearched takes that we explored on the show regarded a precedent of moving away from *student startups*

- As SkyDeck batches have come and gone, we've seen less companies centered around solving common collegiate problems like notetaking, payments, ridesharing, replaced by companies working on disruptive AI, next-generation robotics and even [super-sweet strawberries](https://www.oishii.com/) — "are students just burnt out?"
- We explored the requirements necessary to become a SkyDeck startup and how much it's worth given it's slow veer away from fulfilling the role of *the* Berkeley accelerator

## Office Hours with The House

Whether you're current students or a number of years out of Berkeley, if you're working on a startup, [apply before April 22nd to put some time down with The House](https://thehousecal.typeform.com/to/gFIuafq1#source=btf), an early stage fund empowering Cal founders.

## A Call-in from Tanthai, Head of Design at DRF

In line with last week's episode on HQ roles at Dorm Room Fund, we got our first call-in from [Tanthai Pongstien](https://twitter.com/tanthaip), who is currently Head of Design at DRF and a current senior at Cal. We talk who Tanthai would be if not for HQ and try to get Brandon to apply — if you think you'd be better fit for the role than him, [apply to HQ by April 18th](https://join.dormroomfund.com/)!

## Do One Better with Maitri and Gibson

Fast following our first guest, [Maitri Shah '20](https://twitter.com/maitrishahhhh) and [Gibson Chu '20](https://twitter.com/gibsontchu) hopped on for a little bit to talk about their launch of [Do One Better](https://doonebetter.today/), a free resource for sustainable and ethically-produced alternatives to daily-use products. This section of the show was much more dense than we had slotted time for, so we turned it into a bonus episode!
