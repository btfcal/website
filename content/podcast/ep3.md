## P/NP in the Summer

Recently, the Faculty for the College of Letters and Science (L&S) extended the policy for pass/no pass (P/NP) grades through summer. What this means is that for classes required to declare, for majors in L&S, summer classes taken P/NP instead of for a grade count towards that calculation. We explored the idea of a more lenient P/NP system, Moffitt traditions, and the idea of building instead of competing against a grade-deflated unrewarding climb. Some references we brought up in discussion come from a [framework of education disruption from a16z's \*What's Next for Education Startups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylr7A1Gk0Bg)\* and [Balaji Srinivasan's 1729](https://1729.com/?utm_source=Build+The+Future).

## HBSA Elections

Elections for the Haas Business School Association are in full swing. We explore why election platforms at Haas always feel the same, question underlying nepotism + motivations, talk about expanding Haas to represent more than just the ABCs, and generally give Vedika (_luckily_ the podcast's only Haas cohost) a hard time.
